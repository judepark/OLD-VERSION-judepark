<br/>

### The Project

####<a href="https://onesearch.library.utoronto.ca/library-info/ROBARTS" title="Robarts Library Website" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Robarts Library</a>, the the largest academic library in Canada, installed informational kiosks in 2011 that are out of date and not useful to users. These kiosks were redesigned as a wayfinding tool for prospective patrons to find the information they needed within the library.

<br/>

### Overview

| My Role       | Team          | Duration      | Client        | Status        |
| ------------- |:-------------:| ------------- |:-------------:|:-------------:|
| UI/UX Research/Design, Experience Map     | 5             | 3.5 mo.      | UofT Libraries           | Implemented         |

<br/>

### The Problem 1

####Without discoverability, kiosks remain unused.

####┗ **98%** of patrons was not aware of the kiosks' existence.

<br/>

### The Problem 2

####Users preferred speaking to real live people rather than using kiosks.

####┗ **90%** of patrons preferred in-person interaction than a system.

<br/>

### The Problem 3

####The information on the kiosk did not reflect the real world of using the library space. 

####┗ **70%** of patrons could not successfully find information using the kiosk's map interface.

<br/>

### Business Goal

####Create an Experience Map to understand the flow of user's journey within the library. Design the interface to provide information that could be applied to wayfinding.

### Research

#### ┗ **3** Meetings with Stakeholders 
#### ┗ **10** Field Studies
#### ┗ **40+** Questionnaires with Patrons
#### ┗ **3** Interviews with library service providers

### Solutions

#### Experience Map that clearly illustrates each touchpoints of the user's journey at Robarts Library, with brand new interface system for users to interact with on the kisosks.

<br/>

### Solution 1: Experience Map

![Experience Map](https://66.media.tumblr.com/50d50f011340527059d438e0d8e67fd0/tumblr_po0aqmIeKJ1taz7avo1_1280.png "Experience Map of Robarts Library")

#### Understanding the locality and specific uses of each touchpoint in a user's journey from when they enter the library to when they arrive at their goal, allowed us to better understand the issues of discoverability (As highlighted in "painpoints", we recommended placing the kiosks at the painpoints where users most often got lost.)

<br/>

### Solution 2 & 3: New System

#### To overcome people's natural instinct to talk to humans than systems, we recommended placing the kiosks in existing stations where service workers worked during office hours (9AM-4PM). This way, during afterhours users could utilize their existing mental models of where the service points are located to be encouraged to use the kiosks. We implemented a map system to allow users to find the resources they needed without any human interactions.

### Challenges Confronted

#### This project was particularly memorable for an issue that arised between the stakeholders and their leaders. During the research gathering stage, we received a complaint from internal employees who were not aware of what we were doing due to lack of internal communication with the stakeholders. This led to an unnecessary delay, and we learned as consultants that we should triple confirm with our stakeholders on how prepared the rest of the organization is to take on such projects.

<br/>

### Takeaways

1. > #### Users respond more positively to iterative prototypes. Meaning, data was more efficiently gathered when testing a singular functions rather than multiple functions. A more specific bottom-up approach (increased clarity of intent of interactive element added) uncovered painpoints more clearly.

2. > #### Do not be limited to project outlines. The existing kiosk system did not offer a map view of the library that could led each user to their destination. Yet in our research that was consistently what the users desired. Although it was beyond project scope, to offer what the users wanted most from the system we implemented a map system thus providing a potential for the library to cut down on costs on their service for not only their off-hours but throughout their whole service providing system.

3. > #### Experience Maps are very time-consuming to produce, and may not be appropriate from small scale projects.


### Final Thoughts

#### Working with stakeholders as UX consultants gave us an appreciation for all the communications that went into such business project. Experience Mapping was also an interesting challenge where the final result gave an overview of the entire user journey in one coherent view. We also had James Kalbach, the writer of Experince Mapping textbook, skype in on two lectures to review and give feedback for our experience maps and to teach us about experience mapping, giving us a level of expertise in what not to do in the future.
