<!-- end -->

<br/>

### The Project

#### The <a href="https://clnx.utoronto.ca/home.htm" title="CLNx Website" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Career & Co-Curricular Learning Network</a> (​CLNx​), is an online jobsite portal by University of Toronto. They asked us to redesign the information architecture, involving the website's organization, labeling, search and navigational systems. 

<br/>

### Overview

| My Role       | Team          | Duration      | Client        | Status        |
| ------------- |:-------------:| ------------- |:-------------:|:-------------:|
| UI/UX Research/Design, Experience Map     | 5             | 3.5 mo.      | ITS           | Implemented         |

<br/>

### The Problem 

#### The jobsite lacked key features that allowed users to find jobs successfully.

<br/>

### Business Goal

#### Implemetn three key features into the system to allow users to successfully search for jobs over a course of time.

<br/>

### Research

#### ┗ **3** Sample participants were interviewed to understand information seeking behaviours
#### ┗ **3** Card sorting was performed to understand users' preference of information architecture

<br/>

### Finding

#### ┗ Users main concerns with time constraints, rediscovering previously searched postings, career relevance of each job postings, and ability to navigate through the site for improved search capabilities. 

<br/>

### Solutions

#### Tasks we wanted to the new CLN site to allow for users were: 

#### 1. Finding a job stored on the short list
#### 2. View complete list of all job posts 
#### 3. Finding a job based on keyword search

### Project Report
If you would like to take a look at the 9 use cases and other analysis of the website we did in our 3 project reports, please ask <a href="mailto:jude@judepark.com" title="Jude's Email">me</a>.

<br/>

### Takeaways

1. > #### The 9 use cases we analyzed came in handy in narrowing our focus on the redesign. By focusing our attention to implementing only 3 features that would meet the needs of all of the 9 use cases, we could manage expections within our team and the stakeholders, and provide improvements only pertaining the specific needs we highlited.

2. > #### The data sample was very small. 


### Final Thoughts

#### We were an integral part of CLN's transformation and revamp into CLNx. The feedback from our redesign went into the decision making of transition from CLN to CLNx. The stakeholders at Information Technology Systems (ITS) who handled this transition were very appreciative of our work.
