<br/>

### The Project

#### We were tasked with designing UHN's very first intranet. 

<br/>

### Overview

| My Role       | Team          | Duration      | Client        | Status        |
| ------------- |:-------------:| ------------- |:-------------:|:-------------:|
| UI/UX Research/Design    | 4             | 3.5 mo.      | UHN           | Submitted         |

<br/>

### The Problem

#### The  <a href="https://www.uhn.ca/" title="University Health Network Website" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University Health Network</a> (UHN) is the largest research and hospital network in North America, reaching #1 in funding for Canada. The specialized research lab's current operations relies on sharing organizational information only through weekly meetings. With growth in the organization, time limitations from leadership, and simultaneous experiements and projects underway, it is increasingly becoming difficult to keep researchers updated on everyones projects and reduce redundancies. 

<br/>

### Business Goal

#### Reduce work redundancies by creating an Intranet to improve the information sharing practices of the lab.

<br/>

### Research

#### ┗ **3** Stakeholders Meetings/Touching Base 
#### ┗ **2** with Leadership
#### ┗ **1** Session of Field Study

<br/>

### Solution

#### LabMaster is a central space for lab teams to update their progress with 5 Features


<br/>

### Feature 1: Dashboard: Updates, Projects, Upcoming, Forum

#### The Dashboard (Homepage) is the welcoming page for all employees of UHN to grasp an immediate overview of what is happening at the lab, with Updates (all new SOP/DOCs), Projects (current active projects), Upcoming (events coming up), and Forum (your posts and replies to your posts)

<br/>

### Feature 2: Directory

#### The greatest need for new lab assistants and student was the time it took for them to learn the names and work of every major scientists and lab leads. This was proven in the research to be difficult when they only had a group meeting with these leads once a week. The Directory aims to alleviate this problem, by first showing the organizational hierachy of the organization, with further bio pages for each employee.

<br/>

### Feature 3: Workboard

#### Another problem highlighted by the stakeholders is the lack of communication between current project researchers, leading to unnecessary redundancies in lab work. Workboard aims to alleviate this problem by showcasing the progress of each project by its sSuccesses, Working On, and Stuck elements of the project.

<br/>

### Feature 4: SOP/DOC

![SOP/DOC](https://66.media.tumblr.com/01c1dabc5bbde9b56c79ac5de15a5647/tumblr_po7qghdtzk1taz7avo1_1280.png "LabMaster: SOP/DOC")

#### SOP/DOC, which are the papers and articles published by UHN are currently housed on an archive that employees of UHN must seek out on a seperate internal site. By incorporating the SOP/DOC archive into the intranet, it becomes much easier for employees to find the information in a central location, and also give initial incentive of current employees to begin using the intranet.

<br/>

### Feature 5: Forum

![Forum](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a988f22b4b93102268804009ae4b5b61/tumblr_po7qgxSaqV1taz7avo1_1280.png "LabMaster: Forum")

#### We found the organizational culture and how information is shared at UHN to be quite traditional and waterfall. However a lot of the new lab assistants and students, who make up the majority of the organization are young employees who wish to ask questions relating to the lab freely without the fear of reprecussion or being singled out for asking a "dumb question". To combat this fear and encourage information sharing within the organization, we created a forum where employees can ask annonymous questions relating to a specific experiment or lab questions.

<br/>

### Feature 6: Events

![Events](https://66.media.tumblr.com/465248add7c71e608590f770b2797103/tumblr_po7qh8zhgn1taz7avo1_1280.png "LabMaster: Events")

#### Following the last feature, many employees also felt there was no sense of freedom or fun in the workplace. Events allow employees to share news relating to non-work related events held in the organization, such as the volleyball games that were casually held by some of the lab assistants.

<br/>

### Challenges Confronted

#### The stakeholders of UHN did not give us free access to their employees, and much of our research came from stakeholder meetings with a representative who was quite high up in the organization. This meant that we could only rely on what the individual felt were the problems of the organization, as oppose to asking the users, or researchers of the organization directly. This led ot a lot of speculation, and a lack of quantitiave data to support our design.

<br/>

### Takeaways

1. > #### It is extremely difficult as UX researchers to work with an organization that do not give access to their employees. We had to rely on unconventional methods of catching busy researchers on their way out for lunch or prior engangements to gain some insight of what lab assistants needed in this organization.

2. > #### Design built on speculations could only mean further problems down the road. Although this project was never tested, I assume that if it was implemented at this current stage, there would be many problems due to the lack of user insight. 

3. > #### Some of the wordings we chose for labelling could be improved.

<br/>

### Final Thoughts

#### This was one of my first projects working with real life clients. It showed me the amount of access to users I as a researcher needed in order to design a product that could be any of use for the stakeholders. Next time I would be more aggresive in communicating what I needed from the stakeholders, because if this design was to be a final prototype that got implemetned at the lab, there would have been even more work to be down afterwards to fix what was wrong with the intranet.
