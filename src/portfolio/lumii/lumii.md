### Challenges Confronted

Youth's challenges in today’s job market is only escalated due to their lack of confidence and self-esteem. Mismatch between the level experiences emploeyrs seek vs what youth believe they possess only exasperates confidence. 

Disruptive technologies and technical skills impack. We were in the business of changing perspective, not actual work experience. Futher perspectives needed to be covered, such as mental health, self-discovery and self-esteem.


<br/>

### Takeaways

1. > #### Seemingly obscure and unrelated paths taken in life contribute to the overall character, skills and grit of who we are as individuals. Lumii has the potential to increase young people’s confidence throughout the job search by validating their previous experiences.

2. > #### Accessibility was at the core of Lumii. Our Design Thinking process was dominated by discussions on all youth - regardless of their class, education, disability, economic status or location. We implemented technologies to enable NEET (a young person who is “Not in Education, Employment, or Training”) to access Lumii to its full benefits.

3. >  #### As youths ourselves, we also had a personal agenda for Lumii to succeed. However as young professionals we faced difficulties in our process to address every stakeholder’s input and directions. Even with our goal defined (How can we help people furthest from opportunity?) It was difficult to balance various stakeholder’s expectations while addressing our users’ needs.

### Final Thoughts
If I could re-do Lumii all over again from the start, I would scope down our project. As eager fresh employees, we had a lot to prove and often succumbed to many new pressures. Our mandate was help youth prepare for the future of work, not solve every problem the youth faces. Due to our motivation to succeed, we forgot to dial it back. Lumii would have been quite useful as a self-discovery tool that helps users prepare for interviews, without it also producing the digital presence for users. 4 months was a very short time to go from a general problem statement into an entire solution, ready for implementation. I learned a lot from this experience. As a user researcher who practiced empathy a lot, I often get lost in the worries and pain points of my users, and I tried to address every one of them that came up in the research for Lumii. It is a tendency of mine to always make sure no loopholes are left open. However, in a fast work environment with high-intensity challenges and deadlines - fool-proofing your research does not yield the results that the stakeholders are expecting. I learned to be agile and truly iterative. We went above and beyond from what was required of us and we excelled every expectation throughout the 4 months in creating Lumii. Today I am proud to say that I was one of 4 founders of Lumii.
