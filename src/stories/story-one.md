Apparently we had reached a great height in the atmosphere, for the sky was a dead black, and the stars had ceased to twinkle. By the same illusion which lifts the horizon of the sea to the level of the spectator on a hillside, the sable cloud beneath was dished out, and the car seemed to float in the middle of an immense dark sphere, whose upper half was strewn with silver. Looking down into the dark gulf below, I could see a ruddy light streaming through a rift in the clouds.

two-sentence phrase “I had a haircut this weekend. It’s really \_\_\_\_”
  has some 'obvious'
  Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

[^1]:

  The two-sentence phrase “I had a haircut this weekend. It’s really \_\_\_\_”
  has some obvious conclusions for human beings: “short,” “different,” “bad,”
  “good,” but for machines, naive prediction may only look at the word “really”
  and try to predict how the sentence may end, resulting in suggestions like
  “long” or “excited.” Additionally, because many predictive text engines only
  look at the immediately preceding word, you can end up with never-ending and
  nonsensical sentences just by repeatedly tapping the suggestions on your phone.
  Try it: open up an app that allows you to type, enter “I am” and then keep
  pressing the suggestions that appear in your keyboard.
