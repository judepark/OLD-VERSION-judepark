Following the KonMari philosophy, I was cleaning out the documents in my apartment that I accumulated over the years when I came across an award that I received in high school:

####**"Triumph Award**: This award celebrates the outstanding spirit and determination of a graduating student (or students) who has overcome great personal challenges in order to achieve academic success."

In reflection of those days gone by, I am trying to understand what this award means to me today as a twenty-something adult. 

##The Moment When Everthing Fell Apart

I guess in high school, I had a very tough time. I was an orphan and an immigrant, living with my sisters from check to check. I had also transferred in the middle of the semester, and I missed my friends from my previous neighborhood at Jane and Weston[^1] (This was the early days of smartphones and social media). I probably had the worst three years at that high school. The highlights of my week were swim practices and playing the abandoned piano in the auditorium at lunchtime. 

One day at school, someone broke into my locker and stole my wallet. At the time, we were barely scraping by, where the social checks we received from the government went straight to necessary amenities like my metro pass. There was no way I could afford to get another one that month. On fourth period Chem, I still remember how the sounds of laughter in the classroom suddenly felt sinister. Out of nowhere, I stood up, and walked out of the class. It took me two hours in freezing winter to walk home that afternoon.

The next day at school, I was sitting in front of my guidance counsellor, sobbing. Throughout that morning, the room filled with adults, one by one. It was mortifying, but now I realize, necessary. My guidance counsellor, Mr. Soloman[^2], enrolled me in the free bus ticket program. They made sure I didn't go hungry during lunch time anymore. They made me apply for the Triumph Award. I learned that day you sometimes need to share what you are going through with somebody, even if it feels scary to do so.

Upon hearing that I was selected for the award, they were nice enough to frame it and give it to me, all those years ago.

##Accomplishments on My Wall

My masters cost me 25K, my bachelors 40K, but somehow my Triumph Award feels like a bigger accomplishment for me now. Like the description of the scholarship states, I was able graduate despite extraordinary circumstances and even ended up going to university. 
Of all the framed feats that hang on my wall today, my Triumph Award, a small scholarship in the grand scheme of things that certainly came cheaper than my degrees, holds a special place in my heart. 

##What Success is to Me

I don't measure success by an amount of money or accolades. I measure success by the perseverance that took to keep moving forward, even in the face of adversity. That‚Äôs what I like about my Triumph award. It is a representation of my grit.

Somehow this small award manages to make me smile and beam with pride, every time I look up at it ü§©.

  Mr. Solomon continued to play an important role in me graduating from high school. I remember that for about a month after the incident he would show up randomly on my first period. Looking back, I think that was his discreet way of making sure I made it to school okay and that I was alright.
